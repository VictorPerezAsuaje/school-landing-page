# Responsive School Landing Page

This is a landing page for a school or educational institution requested as a task for my Higher Technitian Course. I wanted to go the extra mile and tried applying more than just plain HTML and CSS, I also used SASS (and BEM) and JS.

The whole website is responsive, so it adapts properly to every size. This one was not done with the mobile-first approach.
